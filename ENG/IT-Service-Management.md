# Usage of ITSM

IT Service Management, often abbreviated as ITSM, describes the way IT teams proceed in the entire delivery of IT services to their customers and employees. This includes all processes and activities related to the planning, assembly, delivery, and support of IT services. The provision and control of services are not exclusive to the IT industry and can also occur in other industries in the form of general service management.

&nbsp;

# Importance of a Process
A process is a regulated sequence of activities. It always has a defined end and a defined starting point. It follows the EVA principle, which states that by introducing desired requirements, a series of regulated steps occurs to achieve a desired outcome.

![Simple Process Flow](https://qualitaetsmanagement.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/071122_Der-Prozess-einfach-erklaert_Logo.jpg)

&nbsp;

[^4]
A process may or may not deliver the desired end result. Hence, multiple interconnected processes may arise, which bring the final result of one process as input to the next until the end. A sequence of processes is referred to as a process chain.

&nbsp;

The course of multiple processes and their conditions, which paths can be taken, can be represented in an Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) model.

![Simple Event-Driven Process Chain](https://imgs.search.brave.com/cWfLjTeeyPGmUGqsetbAOSxnWbtjExyPyiHlccT1uLw/rs:fit:766:1024:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2RlLnBy/b2Nlc3NvcmllbnRh/dGlvbi5jb20vd3At/Y29udGVudC91cGxv/YWRzLzIwMTIvMDEv/RVBLX0JlaXNwaWVs/LTc2NngxMDI0LnBu/Zw)

&nbsp;

# Differentiation of Process Chains
__Process chains are divided into the following types:__
- Value-adding processes
- Support processes
- Management processes

&nbsp;

## Value-adding processes
Value-adding processes are processes directly involved in the creation of a saleable product or service.

&nbsp;

## Support processes
Support processes are necessary to carry out value-adding and management processes.

&nbsp;

## Management processes
Management processes serve the planning, diagnosis, and control of value-adding or support processes. These are usually not as many processes and typically take place at the top management level. They relate to the entire company.

&nbsp;

# Significance of IT Services

An IT service refers to the service developed with the application of technical and business expertise to facilitate the use of technology for businesses and end-users. IT services can be used within the company itself or by third-party providers.

&nbsp;

# Differentiation of Services
__Services can be differentiated into the following categories:__
- Status report
- Customer inquiry
- Incident

&nbsp;

## Status report
These status reports are referred to here as events. These are not authored by a user but are automatically generated by an integrated monitoring system when incidents occur.

__The reports are divided into the following categories:__
- Information: Report without action required
  > Example: Network utilization at 45%.
- Warning: Report requiring closer observation.
  > Example: RAID data array reports remaining capacity of 20%.
- Exception: Report requiring immediate action
  > Example: Network port 48 is down on the switch.

&nbsp;

## Customer inquiry
A formal request from a customer for the improvement or creation of a new service. When information or access is requested, it is a service request usually listed in the service catalog. These are carried out through existing processes.

When requirements are requested for the upgrade of current hardware and software, for example, it is a request for change, where the effort needs to be professionally managed and coordinated. Changes are initiated that restructure existing processes and need to be made understandable to others.

&nbsp;

## Incident
A report of an unplanned interruption of a service. This is also referred to as an incident. In the IT domain, disruptions can occur in the network, computer systems, or software, which can either slow down or completely pause operations. Here, the aim is to ensure continuous operation.

&nbsp;

[^6] 
# Deployment of ITSM Frameworks
For an organization to work efficiently in all departments, as well as with the customer itself, a good structure must be provided for the deployment of services. There are several frameworks for this purpose, each offering its own range of possibilities and approaches, all of which can contribute to meeting the specific requirements of an organization.

__Popular frameworks include:__
- ITIL
- ISO 20000
- COBIT
- FitSM
- DevOps
- SAFe

&nbsp;

## ITIL
The ITIL framework aims to improve the delivery of IT processes to support multiple business objectives.

&nbsp;

## ISO 20000
Leveraging the principles of the ITIL framework but not having a public relationship with it.

&nbsp;

## COBIT
The COBIT IT Governance Framework focuses on continuous IT security and is the opposite of ITIL.

&nbsp;

## FitSM
FitSM is a standard for lightweight service management and additionally includes service portfolio management.

&nbsp;

## DevOps
DevOps utilizes the methodology of cross-functional teams encouraged by open communication. The DevOps framework combines a disjointed set of principles that are connected based on the business requirements of the company.

&nbsp;

## SAFe
The Scaled Agile Framework applies the Agile structure used by software development teams, scaling Agile to larger applications.

&nbsp;

# Types of IT Service Management

In offering and tracking services within the company, various specialized areas exist that can be coordinated differently. Some of these types include:
- Incident Management: Rectification of occurring incidents during ongoing services
- Service Level Management: Provision and control of SLAs
- Problem Management: Rectification of serious incidents during ongoing services
- Change Management: Preparation and implementation of changes to work processes in the company

&nbsp;

# Service Lifecycle according to IMAC/R/D
Internationally widespread, companies illustrate the execution of their service lifecycle according to the IMAC/R/D representation. Here, customers can categorize their problems and inquiries directly in one of the phases when contacting the company. The representation is generally used for all services and provides customers with better navigation within the existing company system through the specific differentiation of all services.

![IMAC/R/D Lifecycle](https://www.i-doit.com/hs-fs/hubfs/imac-r-d-1600x900-1.jpg?width=550&height=309&name=imac-r-d-1600x900-1.jpg)

&nbsp;

## Install
Installation and configuration of a system or object.
>Example: Setting up an IT workstation with a functioning computer, suitable peripherals, monitors, network connection, and office software products.

&nbsp;

## Move
Provision, packaging, reconfiguration of existing devices, followed by transportation to the new environment.
>Example: Moving a development team along with necessary devices from the ground floor to the first floor.

&nbsp;

## Add
Addition and configuration of additional components.
>Example: Installation of an external graphics unit in a computer with dependent graphics drivers.

&nbsp;

## Change
Update or replacement of existing components.
>Example: Exchange of a hard drive with all stored data for a larger one with more storage capacity.

&nbsp;

## Remove
Preparation and securing of components to be removed from a deployed system.
>Example: Dismantling a workstation with all connected devices.

&nbsp;

## Dispose
Disposal or refurbishment of unused or defective devices.
>Example: Proper disposal of a defective network card.

&nbsp;

# Significance of SLAs
A Service Level Agreement is an agreement between a customer and a service provider for the detailed regulation of recurring services. The customer demands a service defined in an SLA and checks if it has been fulfilled. If a service expands to a larger scope, reference is usually made to the existing SLA, and after the service is provided, it is extended with the additional content.

An SLA contains individual service levels with factors of quality and time. Measures are also drafted if there are disruptions in the execution of a desired service. Penalties are also included if an SLA is not adhered to, as well as agreements on quality controls of existing SLAs.

&nbsp;

## SLA Content
- Description
  - What service is provided when and where by whom?
- Subservices
  - Result of the service and customer benefit from its use.
- Process
  - Process steps for execution.
- Framework conditions
  - System environment, infrastructure, participation obligations, out-of-scope delimitation.

&nbsp;

## SLA Quality
- KPIs
  - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are needed for operationalization and quality dimensioning.
- Measurement methods
  - Measurement methods for determining the base data of the indicators and their preparation (e.g., Balanced Scorecard).
- Service Levels
  - Quality dimensions for the service, e.g., response time, recovery time, availability in %, performance, accessibility, security
  - SLA limitations (e.g., third-party influence)
  - Maintenance windows and downtimes

&nbsp;

## SLA Costs
- Pricing model
  - Billing model (fixed price, variable according to time and effort)
  - Defined contents
  - Unregulated contents
  - Extent of SLA violations
  - Extent of repeated SLA violations
  - Expiry of SLAs

&nbsp;

# Incident Management
The core of Incident Management is the resolution of any incidents that can negatively impact the flow of business processes in various ways.

<a href="https://advisera.com/20000academy/knowledgebase/itil-incident-management-separate-roles-different-support-levels/">
  <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/2OIwiEv6-3r--ZBh5UE3uFIUlgPMcGRYAW1dzkGeJ9w/rs:fit:600:401:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZHZp/c2VyYS5jb20vd3At/Y29udGVudC91cGxv/YWRzL3NpdGVzLzYv/MjAxNS8wNy9JVElM/X3JvbGVfc2VwYXJh/dGlvbi5wbmc" width="500" title="Incident Management">
</A>

&nbsp;

When an incident occurs, the environment is first categorized with a tracking system, whether it is in the area of software, hardware, or network. The incident is then prioritized based on urgency and impact. This is done at the Helpdesk or generally the Single Point of Contact (also known as SPOC) and provides first-level support for the reporting person.

Here, the Known Error Database is checked for a similar context and an attempt is made to offer a solution. If a solution is found and it has resolved the disruption, the process is successfully completed and documented.

If the problem is not resolved to satisfaction due to a lack of expertise and recorded entries, the requirements of the defined SLAs are not met, and the incident is escalated.

The incident now becomes a problem, and there is a more specialized treatment by experts with more knowledge in second-level support. Not every incident automatically becomes a problem, as it depends on the prioritization and the environment.

If satisfaction cannot be achieved here according to the written SLAs, then a final escalation to third-level support occurs with professionals who have the influence to change the system in every detail aspect.

When a solution is found at the current level, a report is made to the previous level until nothing further can be escalated. All steps are documented along the way and stored in the Known Error Database for future incidents. If the customer is satisfied after all operations have been carried out, this process has also been successfully completed.
