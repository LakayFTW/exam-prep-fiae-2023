[^1]

By definition according to DIN ISO 69901, a project is characterized by the following seven criteria:

- Uniqueness of the project
- Concrete objectives (cost, schedule: defined start and end point, resources)
- Temporal, financial, and personnel limitations
- Interdisciplinary nature of the tasks and team
- Complexity
- Unusualness
- Novelty

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Model-Driven Software Development

## Development Philosophy
- Agile Unified Process (AUP)

# Network Diagram
[^2]
DIN 69 900 describes the methods for scheduling and planning in project management, defines network diagrams as graphical or tabular representations of a sequence of activities consisting of events and relationships.

## Main Function of the Network Diagram
A network diagram forms the basis for scheduling and has the following functions:
- It helps determine the total duration of a project.
- It establishes the temporal and logical sequence of activities in a project.
- It visualizes the critical path and thus the activities that can endanger the planned project end.
- It represents possible buffers or reserves in the schedule.

## Elements of a Network Diagram 
A network diagram is a tool from graph theory that consists of nodes and arrows. It has three essential elements:

- An activity is an action with an earliest and latest start and finish time.
- An event is a defined, describable state in the project process.
- An precedence relationship defines the logical - i.e., technical, and personnel - and the temporal dependency between individual activities; it always exists between exactly two nodes.
